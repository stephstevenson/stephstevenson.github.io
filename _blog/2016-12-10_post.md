# H1
Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page.
## H2
Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page.
### H3
Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page.

#### H4
Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

--------
You can make lists like these:
  * one
  * two
  * three

And these:
  1. One
  2. Two
  3. Three

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

```
layout: article
title: Project
description: a post
 with a background image
image: {{ site.baseurl }}/images/cupofcoffee.jpg
```

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pines.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/balloons.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/images/balloons.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/images/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
