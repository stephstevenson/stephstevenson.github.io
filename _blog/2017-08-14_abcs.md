With every new endeavor, there is an inspiration. There are so many people in my life who have inspired me, but it was my dad who came up with the idea for me to start a blog one day while I was complaining that I was soooo bored as and empty nester. As a woman being dragged (kicking and screaming) into "mid-life", I was searching for something to call my own. I would consider myself a dabbler, or better known as a jack of all trades and a master of none. Luckily, my son (who also happens to be a computer science major) was my biggest encourager, and created this beautiful blog for me, as well as an easy (well, easier for a cavemom) application tool to write my blog.

After the birth of the initial idea to blog, came the brainstorming...What to call my blog, What to write about, Is anyone really going to be interested in reading what I have to say...

The name of my blog, Could Be, was actually my son's idea. He asked me when we were trying to come up with a name, "what was that thing you and Grams used to always say?" And with that, the blog was named! The story goes something like this... Many years ago my mom (Grams) and I were out shopping (like we did every Saturday), when we saw a sign advertising a business called "Could Be Dog Grooming". We were so tickled that we laughed and laughed until we had tears rolling down our cheeks. After that day, every time the opportunity arose, we would say "could be", and the other would respond "could be dog grooming". At that point we would both burst into giggles! I'm pretty sure anyone near us, family included, thought we had lost our marbles! After years of this ritual, our family finally accepted the fact that we were always going to try and squeeze it in whenever possible, and then laugh hysterically at our own wittiness.

My other inspirators(is that a word? or is it a new "stephism"?)are my beautiful sister, who inspires me everyday with her grace, kindness and entrepeneurial spirit, and the love of my life, who never ceases to amaze me in the breadth of his generousity and loyalty(my very own superhero). So you see I've been extremely blessed to have these fine people in my life! One last person, even though she's no longer with us on earth, my mom. Without her, "Could Be" could not have been.![http://www.lanlinglaurel.com/data/out/123/5030802-heart-pics.jpg](http://)
