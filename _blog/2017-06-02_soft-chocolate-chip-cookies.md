Is there anything better than a fresh batch of soft chocolate chip cookies? I think not.

All the good cookie eaters of the world!
We were made for such a time as this.

These cookies are soft, thick, bricks of chocolate chunks and buttery dough baked into a heavy, milk-loving cookie that is my most favorite chocolate chip cookie of all time. ♡


Wait, though. They are singing a love song to you: **BAKE ME**.

**BAKE ME IN YOUR OVEN RIGHT NOW.**

A few years ago, when we were living in the Philippines, I accidentally discovered my new favorite way to make cookies. The recipe is now two years old, but if you like to creep, they can be located here.

And let me just take a moment to acknowledge that seriously without fail – everything good that I make is always inspired by haphazard accidents, including but not limited to broken refrigerators and lacking ingredients and my really strong tendency towards laziness. Everything including these cookies and all their iterations.

So in 90 bajillion degree Cebu, Philippines, back in fateful 2012, yes I WAS trying to bake chocolate chip cookies. In true Pinch of Yum must-have-the-food-now style, it made 0% rational sense. I had butter that was literally melted from sitting out on the counter for, like, three seconds, I had NO brown sugar, and I added a little too much extra flour. I proceeded to bake the accidental cookies in my oven which I had to start by lighting a FIRE with a MATCH inside of it and which had NO TEMPERATURE MARKINGS other than the numbers 1-5. Sage and I are laughing out loud over here – howwww did I do anything?
