Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

	---
	layout: post
	title: Project
	description: a post

	image: cupofcoffee.jpg
	---


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ '/images/tunnel.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="tunnel" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ '/images/autumn.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="autumn leaves" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ '/images/ocean.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="ocean" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ '/images/dock.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="dock" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ '/images/balloons.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="balloons" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ '/images/goldengate.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="golden gate" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above:

<div class="img_row">
  <img class="col two" alt="balloons" src="{{ '/images/balloons.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/>
  <img class="col one" alt="golden gate" src="{{ '/images/goldengate.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/>
</div>
